# Docker Image for Knowage

[![Docker badge](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/knowagelabs/knowage-server-docker.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/knowagelabs/knowage-server-docker/)

## What is Knowage?

Knowage is the professional open source suite for modern business analytics over traditional sources and big data systems.

## Run Knowage

Differently from its predecessor (i.e. SpagoBI), you can use ```docker-compose``` or ```Docker Swarm``` for running Knowage with a [MariaDB container](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb). This will be shipped with within a single command.

Both ways need to be defined by a simple text file in [YAML](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) format that describes which containers must be run.

Pay attention that for both YAML files in this project, the DBMS stores its data in a volume called ```db``` to make them permanent between multiple run of the DBMS. If you want to reset DB data you need to delete that volume.

### Use docker-compose

If you want to run Knowage on your local machine, with minimum configuration, for testing purpose, run this command inside the folder with ```docker-compose.yml``` file:

```console
$ docker-compose up
```

This launch the DBMS and Knowage in attached mode: here you can see logs of both the container at the same time. To stop both containers you can use ```CTRL+C```. If you want to run Knowage in detached mode use ```-d``` option like:

```console
$ docker-compose up -d
```

If you want to remove all the containers that Knowage created, just use:

```console
$ docker-compose down
```

In that case, you can also use ```-v``` option to delete all the data of the DBMS that are stored the the relative volume.

### Use Docker Swarm

If you want to run Knowage in a Docker Swarm cluster, with the ability to scale up the main app or the DB, to create complex deployment configuration or to enhance the security with Docker Secrets, run this command inside the folder with ```docker-swarm.yml``` file:

```console
$ docker stack deploy -c docker-swarm.yml knowage
```

If you want to stop Knowage and remove all created containers, you can use:

```console
$ docker stack rm knowage
```


### Environment variables

Knowage need a specific set of environment variables to correctly start.:

* ```DB_HOST``` : *mandatory* - define the DB host.
* ```DB_PORT``` : *mandatory* - specify the DB port.
* ```DB_DB``` : *mandatory* - specify the DB name.
* ```DB_USER``` : *mandatory* - specify the DB user.

* ```DB_CONNECTION_MAX_IDLE``` : *optional* - Set the max number of idle connection
* ```DB_CONNECTION_WAIT_MS``` : *optional* - Max wait time in millis for a new connection 
* ```DB_TYPE``` : *optional* - Default to ``MYSQL``, one between ``MYSQL``, ``MARIADB``, ``ORACLE`` (needs the driver)  and ``POSTGRES``
* ```DB_DO_INITIALIZATION``` : *optional* - Default to ``true``, write everything else if you want to skip DB initialization
* ```CACHE_DB_HOST``` : *mandatory* - define the cache DB host.
* ```CACHE_DB_PORT``` : *mandatory* - specify the cache DB port.
* ```CACHE_DB_DB``` : *mandatory* - specify the cache DB name.

* ```SENSIBLE_DATA_ENCRYPTION_SECRET``` : *mandatory* - define the secret used to encrypt sensible data.
* ```PUBLIC_ADDRESS``` : *optional* - define the IP Host of Knowage visible from outside the container (eg. ```http://$PUBLIC_ADDRESS:8080/knowage```),  the url's host part of Knowage URL. If not present (like the above examples) the default value is the IP of container. You can use the IP of virtual machine (in OSX or Windows environment) or localhost if you map the container's port.
* ```AJP_SECRET``` : *optional* - define the secret used to connect the AJP connector.
* ```HAZELCAST_HOSTS``` : *optional* - Comma separeted hostnames of an Hazelcast cluster (for example, "host1,host2,host3")
* ```HAZELCAST_PORT``` : *optional* - Port of every host of an Hazelcast cluster (for example, "5701")
* ```SSO_CLASS``` : *optional* - Fully qualified class name for custom SSO implementation

You can edit the file ```.env``` to set every variables you need.

### Docker secrets

If your run Knowage in a Docker Swarm, you may want to use secrets to define the value of the variables above. If you append ```_FILE``` to the name of the preceding environment variables you can specify the path of a Docker Secret that will be available to a running container.

For example, if you create the following secrets:

```console
$ printf "knowagedb"           | docker secret create knowage_db_host -
$ printf "3306"                | docker secret create knowage_db_port -
$ printf "knowagedb"           | docker secret create knowage_db_db   -
$ printf "knowageuser"         | docker secret create knowage_db_user -
$ printf "knowagepassword"     | docker secret create knowage_db_pass -

$ printf "knowagedb"           | docker secret create knowage_cache_db_host -
$ printf "3306"                | docker secret create knowage_cache_db_port -
$ printf "knowagedb"           | docker secret create knowage_cache_db_db   -
$ printf "knowageuser"         | docker secret create knowage_cache_db_user -
$ printf "knowagepassword"     | docker secret create knowage_cache_db_pass -

$ printf "abc123"              | docker secret create knowage_hmac_key                            -
$ printf "def456"              | docker secret create knowage_password_encryption_secret_key      -
$ printf "ghi789"              | docker secret create knowage_sensible_data_encryption_secret_key -
```

You can create a YAML file for Docker Swarm like:

```console
version: "3.1"
services:
  knowage:
    image: knowagelabs/knowage-server-docker:8.1
    hostname: knowage
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - DB_HOST_FILE=/run/secrets/knowage_db_host
      - DB_PORT_FILE=/run/secrets/knowage_db_port
      - DB_DB_FILE=/run/secrets/knowage_db_db
      - DB_USER_FILE=/run/secrets/knowage_db_user
      - DB_PASS_FILE=/run/secrets/knowage_db_pass

      - CACHE_DB_HOST_FILE=/run/secrets/knowage_cache_db_host
      - CACHE_DB_PORT_FILE=/run/secrets/knowage_cache_db_port
      - CACHE_DB_DB_FILE=/run/secrets/knowage_cache_db_db
      - CACHE_DB_USER_FILE=/run/secrets/knowage_cache_db_user
      - CACHE_DB_PASS_FILE=/run/secrets/knowage_cache_db_pass

      - HMAC_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/knowage_hmac_key
      - PASSWORD_ENCRYPTION_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/knowage_password_encryption_secret_key
      - SENSIBLE_DATA_ENCRYPTION_SECRET=/run/secrets/knowage_sensible_data_encryption_secret_key
```

See ```docker-swarm.yml``` for an example.

## Use Knowage

By default, Knowage run its container on the port ```8080/tcp```, as you can see from the sample YAML files. If you set your ```PUBLIC_ADDRESS``` environment to ```localhost``` or ```127.0.0.1```, you can point your browser to:

> http://localhost:8080/knowage

And you could see the login page of Knowage. If this doesn't happen you have to check Docker configuration to see on what network interface container ports are exposed: by default, Docker should use all network interfaces on the host (the IP ```0.0.0.0``` means all interface).

If you need to expose ports only on a specific ip, you need to add it to ports declaration like:

```console
version: "3.1"
services:
  knowage:
    image: knowagelabs/knowage-server-docker:8.1
    hostname: knowage
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"
    ...
```

By default, the available users are:

|User   |Password|
|-------|--------|
|biadmin|biadmin |
|bidev  |bidev   |
|biuser |biuser  |

## Run Knowage demo

If you want to run Knowage with some dummy data and some pre-made documents, there is a specific docker-compose you can use.

Follow the instructions from the "use docker-compose section", but add the -f property to point to the demo docker-compose:

```console
$ docker-compose up -f docker-compose-demo.yml
```
Using some externally defined database like foodmart mysql, the first container start can take up to 5 minutes to populate the databases.

When finished you should be able to navigate to the following link (if you haven't changed related properties in the docker-compose file):
> http://localhost:18080/knowage

By default, the available users are:

|User   |Password|
|-------|--------|
|biadmin|biadmin |
|demo_admin (suggested one)  |demo_admin   |
